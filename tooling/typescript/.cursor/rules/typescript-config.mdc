# TypeScript Config Conventions

- Shared configs live in `tooling/typescript/*.json` and should be kept small and composable.
- Apps/packages should extend a shared base (`base.json`, `nextjs.json`, `react-library.json`) instead of copying large compilerOptions blocks.
- Prefer repo-wide changes in shared configs over one-off overrides in individual workspaces.
