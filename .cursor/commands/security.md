# Security Audit

Perform a security audit on the selected code. Check for:

1. Injection (SQL/XSS/command)
2. Auth/session issues
3. Data exposure (PII/secrets in logs)
4. Access control (missing authorization checks)
5. Dependency risk (known vulnerable packages)

For each finding:
- Severity: Critical / High / Medium / Low
- Impact and exploit scenario
- Recommended fix (with a minimal code example)
