# Optimize Performance

Analyze the selected code for performance issues and optimize.

Look for:
- Unnecessary re-renders or recomputations
- N+1 queries or redundant API calls
- Inefficient algorithms
- Blocking work on the critical path

For each issue:
1. Explain why it's a problem
2. Show an improved approach
3. Call out tradeoffs (if any)
