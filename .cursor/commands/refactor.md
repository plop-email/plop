# Refactor Code

Refactor the selected code to improve:
1. Readability (naming, structure)
2. Maintainability (DRY, single responsibility)
3. Performance (only if no behavior change)

Rules:
- Do not change external behavior or APIs unless explicitly requested
- Keep changes minimal and aligned with local patterns
