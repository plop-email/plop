# Debug Issue

Help me debug this code. I'm experiencing an issue.

Please:
1. Analyze: Look for potential bugs, edge cases, or logic errors
2. Identify: Pinpoint the most likely cause of the issue
3. Explain: Why this bug occurs and under what conditions
4. Fix: Provide the corrected code
5. Prevent: Suggest how to avoid similar issues in the future

If you need more context about the error or expected behavior, ask me.
If there are multiple potential issues, list them in order of likelihood.
