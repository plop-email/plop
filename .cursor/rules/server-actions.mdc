# Server Actions (next-safe-action)

- Actions are a boundary. Validate inputs with Zod and keep effects explicit.
- Prefer shared action clients:
  - `actionClient` / `actionClientWithMeta` / `authActionClient` in `apps/app/src/actions/safe-action.ts`
- For authenticated actions:
  - Require a user session (via Supabase) and fail fast.
  - Apply rate limiting consistently (see `@plop/kv/ratelimit`).
- Keep returned error messages safe for end users (no secrets, no stack traces).
