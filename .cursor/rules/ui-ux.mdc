# UI/UX Guardrails

## Accessibility

- Prefer native semantics (`button`, `a`, `label`, `table`) before adding ARIA.
- Ensure visible focus (`:focus-visible`) and full keyboard support for interactive UI.
- Icon-only buttons must include an accessible label (`aria-label` or visible text).

## Forms

- Don’t block paste in inputs.
- Show validation errors inline near the field and focus the first invalid field on submit.
- Use correct `type`, `inputMode`, and valid `autoComplete` tokens.

## Navigation

- Links are links: use `<a>`/`<Link>` for navigation so open-in-new-tab works.
- Keep URL and state in sync (filters/tabs/pagination).
