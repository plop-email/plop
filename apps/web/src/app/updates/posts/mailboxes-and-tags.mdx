Plop uses a simple address pattern to keep your email flows deterministic. You can route multiple flows into the same mailbox and distinguish them by tag.

## The pattern

Use `mailbox+tag@in.plop.email`.

Examples:

- `qa+signup@in.plop.email`
- `qa+login@in.plop.email`
- `billing+invoice@in.plop.email`

All messages for `qa+*` land in the `qa` mailbox. Tags let you isolate flows without creating dozens of mailboxes.

## Why it matters

Tests need a consistent target. When each flow has its own tag, your API calls become stable and you avoid fuzzy matching on subject lines.

## Suggested usage

1. Pick a mailbox per environment (`qa`, `staging`, `prod`).
2. Use tags for each flow (`signup`, `reset`, `invite`).
3. Fetch the latest message by mailbox + tag in your tests.

That is it. No more inbox hunting.
