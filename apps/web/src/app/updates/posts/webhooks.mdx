You can now receive real-time webhook notifications when emails land in your mailbox. No more polling.

## How it works

Register an HTTPS endpoint in **Settings → Webhooks**. When a new email arrives, plop sends a `POST` request with the message metadata:

```json
{
  "event": "email.received",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-06T12:00:00.000Z",
  "data": {
    "id": "msg_abc123",
    "mailbox": "qa",
    "mailboxWithTag": "qa+signup",
    "tag": "signup",
    "from": "sender@example.com",
    "to": "qa+signup@in.plop.email",
    "subject": "Welcome to Acme",
    "receivedAt": "2026-02-06T11:59:58.000Z",
    "domain": "in.plop.email"
  }
}
```

## Signed payloads

Every request includes an `X-Plop-Signature` header so you can verify the payload was sent by plop and hasn't been tampered with:

```ts
import { createHmac, timingSafeEqual } from "node:crypto";

const [tPart, v1Part] = header.split(",");
const timestamp = tPart.replace("t=", "");
const receivedSig = v1Part.replace("v1=", "");

const expected = createHmac("sha256", secret)
  .update(`${timestamp}.${body}`)
  .digest("hex");

const valid = timingSafeEqual(
  Buffer.from(expected),
  Buffer.from(receivedSig),
);
```

## Retries and delivery logs

Failed deliveries are retried up to 3 times with exponential backoff. You can inspect every attempt — status code, latency, and error — in the delivery logs under **Settings → Webhooks**.

## Plan availability

Webhooks are available on **Team** plans and above. [Read the docs](https://docs.plop.email/docs/webhooks) for the full setup guide.
