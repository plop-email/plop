Email often contains sensitive information. Plop is built around access controls, auditability, and minimal retention.

## Security principles

- Least-privilege access for accounts and API keys.
- Explicit mailbox permissions for teams.
- Clear audit trails for inbound messages and access.

## Retention controls

You decide how long to keep messages. Set retention windows per environment, and delete data when you no longer need it. For teams with compliance requirements, that means predictable cleanup without manual scripts.

## What we do not do

- We do not read message content for ad targeting.
- We do not sell personal data.
- We do not expose your inbox data to third parties without consent.

If you need a specific compliance review, contact us and we will share our security posture and architecture details.
