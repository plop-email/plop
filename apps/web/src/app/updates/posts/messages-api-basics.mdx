The Messages API is designed for automation. It gives you predictable access to inbound email without scraping an inbox UI.

## Core endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|
| `GET /v1/messages/latest` | Fetch the newest message for a mailbox + tag |
| `GET /v1/messages` | List messages with filters |
| `GET /v1/messages/:id` | Fetch a specific message by id |

## Example: latest message

```bash
curl "https://api.plop.email/v1/messages/latest?mailbox=qa&tag=signup"
```

## Example: list with filters

```bash
curl "https://api.plop.email/v1/messages?mailbox=qa&tag=signup&limit=10"
```

## Recommended patterns

- Use `latest` for E2E tests and health checks.
- Use lists for dashboards or workflow automation.
- Store message ids in your workflow logs for traceability.

If you need a new filter or payload field, tell us. We design this API around real workflows, not theoretical mail clients.
