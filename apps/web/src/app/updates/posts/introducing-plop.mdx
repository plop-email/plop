Email touches almost every workflow: onboarding, password resets, invoices, support, and long-tail alerts. Yet most teams still debug inboxes manually or maintain brittle test scripts. plop.email turns inbound email into structured data with a first-class API and UI.

## What plop.email does

- Routes inbound email into mailboxes and tags.
- Stores raw and normalised content for reliable access.
- Exposes a simple Messages API for automation.
- Supports mailbox + tag routing for teams and environments.

## Built for production and for tests

Plop works in both the product and the pipeline. You can route live notifications into a support mailbox, and you can also pull the latest test email in CI with a single API call.

## Why we built it

We needed a system that made email reliable for automated workflows without standing up a full mail stack. That meant clear routing rules, deterministic access, and zero guesswork when something fails.

If your team relies on email anywhere in your stack, plop.email helps you keep it boring, fast, and visible.
