# Web Patterns (`@plop/web`)

## Goals

- Keep pages fast and mostly static/server-rendered.
- Minimize client JS; use `"use client"` only for interactive widgets.
- Prioritize SEO (metadata, OG images, clean headings).

## Conventions

- Prefer server actions for form submissions (e.g. newsletter subscribe).
- Validate user inputs at the boundary (Zod) before calling external APIs.
- Keep components small and presentation-focused; avoid pulling app/business logic into the marketing site.
