## Implementation

### Location

```
packages/billing/src/plans.ts
```

### Usage

The `isReservedMailboxName()` function checks all reserved names:

```typescript
import { isReservedMailboxName } from '@plop/billing'

// Check if a mailbox name is reserved
if (isReservedMailboxName('ceo')) {
  throw new Error('Mailbox name is reserved')
}

// Validation in mailbox creation
const mailboxNameSchema = z
  .string()
  .transform((value) => value.toLowerCase())
  .refine((value) => !isReservedMailboxName(value), {
    message: 'Mailbox name is reserved.'
  })
```

### Validation Points

Reserved names are checked at:

1. **Mailbox creation** (`inbox.mailboxes.create`)
2. **Mailbox update** (`inbox.mailboxes.update`)
3. **Auto-setup flow** (`team.autoSetup`)
4. **Starter mailbox** (`inbox.mailboxes.ensureStarterMailbox`)

<Callout type="info">
All checks are **case-insensitive** - "CEO", "ceo", and "Ceo" are all blocked.
</Callout>

## Adding Reserved Names

To add new reserved names, edit `RESERVED_MAILBOX_NAMES` in `packages/billing/src/plans.ts`:

```typescript
export const RESERVED_MAILBOX_NAMES = new Set([
  // ... existing names ...

  // New Category
  "new-reserved-name",
  "another-reserved",
  // ... more names ...
])
```

<Steps>
<Step>
**Identify the category**

Place new names in the appropriate category (or create a new one).
</Step>

<Step>
**Add with comment**

Include category comment explaining the security rationale.
</Step>

<Step>
**Consider variations**

Add common variations (hyphens, underscores, plurals).
</Step>

<Step>
**Test validation**

Ensure the name is properly blocked in mailbox creation.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Recommended Additions

<Callout type="tip">
**Future considerations** for expanding the reserved list:

- **Cryptocurrency**: coinbase, binance, crypto, bitcoin, ethereum
- **Healthcare**: doctor, hospital, medical, patient, healthcare
- **Education**: university, college, student, admissions, registrar
- **Regional Government**: specific country agencies (hmrc, cra, ato, etc.)
</Callout>

## Security Best Practices

### Why Reserve Names?

<Tabs items={['Without Protection', 'With Protection']}>
<Tab value="Without Protection">
❌ **Vulnerable System:**
```
Attacker creates: ceo@in.plop.email
Sends to employee: "Urgent wire transfer needed"
Employee trusts @in.plop.email domain
Result: $50,000 fraudulent transfer
```
</Tab>

<Tab value="With Protection">
✅ **Protected System:**
```
Attacker attempts: ceo@in.plop.email
System blocks: "Mailbox name is reserved"
Attack prevented at source
Result: Employee safe, no fraud
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Defense in Depth

Reserved names are **one layer** of security:

1. **Reserved Names** - Prevent malicious mailbox creation
2. **Email Authentication** - SPF, DKIM, DMARC validation
3. **User Education** - Training on phishing awareness
4. **Rate Limiting** - Prevent bulk mailbox creation
5. **Monitoring** - Detect suspicious patterns

<Callout type="warning">
Reserved names prevent **internal** impersonation. External attackers can still use fake domains. Always verify sender domains and use email authentication.
</Callout>
