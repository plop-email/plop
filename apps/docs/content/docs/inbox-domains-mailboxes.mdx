description: Root vs custom domains, tags, and how mailbox resolution works.
---

This system supports both a shared root domain and per‑team custom domains.

## Domain layout

- **Root inbound domain** is set via `INBOX_ROOT_DOMAIN` (API) and `EMAIL_DOMAIN` (worker).
- **Custom domain** is stored in `teamInboxSettings.domain`.
- Each organisation may also use a subdomain under the root (for example `company1.in.plop.email`).

## Mailbox resolution rules

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Inbound Email] --> B{Custom domain<br/>configured?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Resolve team by<br/>teamInboxSettings.domain]
    C --> D{Mailbox exists?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Store message]
    D -->|No| F[Create mailbox<br/>for team]
    F --> E

    B -->|No| G{Domain = root<br/>domain?}
    G -->|Yes| H[Lookup mailbox by<br/>domain + name]
    H --> I{Found?}
    I -->|Yes| E
    I -->|No| J[404 Not Found]

    G -->|No| K{teamInboxSettings<br/>match?}
    K -->|Yes| C
    K -->|No| J
```

1. **Custom domain configured**
   - `apps/api` resolves the team by `teamInboxSettings.domain = <domain>`.
   - If a mailbox doesn't exist for the team, it is created on first inbound message.

2. **No custom domain**
   - If the inbound domain matches `INBOX_ROOT_DOMAIN`, the API looks up the mailbox by `{ domain: root, name: mailbox }`.
   - If no mailbox exists for the root domain, the webhook returns **404**.

3. **Unknown non‑root domain**
   - If the domain is not the root and there's no `teamInboxSettings` match, the webhook returns **404**.

## Tags and mailbox names

- `support+billing@...` stores the message under mailbox `support` with tag `billing`.
- `mailboxWithTag` is preserved as the full local‑part (`support+billing`).
- Tags are lower‑cased and searchable via the Messages API.

<Callout type="info">
Mailbox names are always normalized to lowercase. Keep mailbox naming consistent in test fixtures and docs.
