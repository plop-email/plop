# `@plop/kv`

Server-only wrapper around Upstash Redis + rate limiting.

## Conventions

- Keep this package server-only (`server-only`) and do not import it from Client Components.
- Prefer typed helpers for common key prefixes; avoid scattered ad-hoc string keys.
- Centralize rate limit policy in `src/ratelimit.ts` so apps behave consistently.
