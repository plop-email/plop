# Shared Package Patterns

The `packages/` directory contains reusable modules shared across the monorepo.

## Packages in this repo

- `packages/ui` (`@plop/ui`): shared UI primitives/components
- `packages/db` (`@plop/db`): Drizzle schema + DB client
- `packages/supabase` (`@plop/supabase`): Supabase clients, types, local project config/migrations
- `packages/kv` (`@plop/kv`): Upstash Redis client + rate limiting
- `packages/logger` (`@plop/logger`): shared `pino` logger
- `packages/analytics` (`@plop/analytics`): OpenPanel client/server helpers
- `packages/email` (`@plop/email`): React Email templates
- `packages/jobs` (`@plop/jobs`): Trigger.dev jobs

## Conventions

- Apps depend on packages; packages must not depend on apps.
- Keep package public APIs explicit via `package.json#exports`; avoid deep imports from consumers.
- Mark server-only modules with `server-only` and keep browser-safe code in separate entry points when needed.
- Prefer small, composable exports over large grab-bag modules.
