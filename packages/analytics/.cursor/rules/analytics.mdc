# `@plop/analytics`

OpenPanel client + server helpers for tracking events.

## Conventions

- Keep event names stable and human-readable.
- In non-production, prefer logging instead of actually sending events.
- On the server, use `waitUntil(...)` for fire-and-forget tracking (don’t block the response).
