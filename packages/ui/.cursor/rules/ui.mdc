# `@plop/ui`

Shared UI primitives and Tailwind utilities.

## Where things live

- Components: `packages/ui/src/components/*`
- Utilities: `packages/ui/src/utils/*`
- Styles: `packages/ui/src/globals.css`

## Conventions

- Keep components presentation-focused (no app-specific business logic).
- Prefer accessible-by-default primitives (keyboard, focus, labels).
- Keep exports stable (update `package.json#exports` when adding a new public entry).
